# Titianic Survivor Heuristic Modelling
A simple heuristic model that will uses passengers' attributes to predict if the person survived the Titanic disaster.
#
Using an available of Titantic passengers and their associated information from http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted/data; I modelled a simple heuristic program to predict where a passenger in the historic titanic ship survived or not.
#
This custom script used various combination of the passenger's attributes and predicted if the passenger survived the Titanic diaster.

    The prediction alogrithm  did beat around 80% accuracy (79.12 % to be precise)
    
    The following attributes were used :
    Pclass          Passenger Class
                    (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)
    Name            Name
    Sex             Sex
    Age             Age
    SibSp           Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard
    Parch           Number of Parents/Children Aboard
    Ticket          Ticket Number
    Fare            Passenger Fare
    Cabin           Cabin
    Embarked        Port of Embarkation
                    (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
